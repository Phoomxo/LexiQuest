# App/device integration — prelogin checkpoint, 2026-09-21

Accepted base: `7407111bbb3f85ae1bc519dfe8b10ed37e501c05`.
Task `01a0bfbd-9961-7da3-982b-77970bdc7027`; writer retained for the user-authorized device testing continuation.

**Vivo V2041 installation, launch, browser device authorization and native login status passed. Inference remains disabled.** OpenAI confirmed sign-in and Ari confirmed the account connection after the explicit status check. The bridge has no turn/thread/reply route. [Evidence](app-device-integration-evidence.json) and [handoff](app-device-integration-handoff.json) distinguish login from inference.

The user explicitly authorized agent taps using the sole cached account and inspection of consent/settings. The blocked Continue button was caused by the disabled Codex device-code authentication switch. Enabling that switch in web ChatGPT security settings and restarting device authorization resolved it. Developer mode, MFA and the existing native ChatGPT session were not changed. Rapid ADB input omitted a character; paced entry succeeded. No passwords, MFA codes, tokens or device challenge values are recorded in this report. The bridge remains ephemeral with a 15-minute lifetime.

## Execution plan

1. Add an opt-in host around ManagedTutorController/Panel. Fence owner/account,
   network, route, background and disposal; test stale completions and cleanup.
   Keep BYOK, database schema and normal application entry unchanged by default.
2. Pin actual App Server login schema. Build an authenticated loopback-only
   developer bridge with isolated memory-only credentials, bounded cleanup and
   no API-key path. Native debug UI must distinguish login from tutor readiness.
   Do not implement inference unless supported no-tool/quota behavior is established.
3. Run bounded verify-scope tests, focused analysis and local binary prelogin
   smoke. Build and inspect debug APK. Check ADB and install only on identifiable
   user Vivo, preserving installed data. Device absence does not block software.
4. Record evidence by simulated/local binary/physical/prelogin/authenticated;
   commit and push tested software, release writer. Live acceptance remains open
   when device/account or provider prerequisite is missing.

Official sources inspected: [App Server](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/app-server)
and [authentication](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/auth). Device-code is beta,
requires ChatGPT security setting, and has no browser callback dependency.
`ephemeral` credential storage is process-memory-only. Neither local logout nor
a successful local test proves provider revoke, Free Thailand, hosted distribution,
quota-only billing, V2, E7 or pilot acceptance.

## Delivered and checked

- Host watches canonical local owner/account and durable epoch; late replies
  cannot survive identity changes. Offline recovery does not resend. Route cover,
  background and disposal cancel tutor work; unsent draft survives offline and
  clears on disconnect/owner change. Default app entry and BYOK are unchanged.
- Native device-code UI opens only the fixed OpenAI URL. No auth polling while
  credentials are entered; user explicitly taps the return/status button. Account
  status is boolean-only. Cancel/navigation tombstones late login responses.
- Local bridge: pinned 0.146.0 binary, separate environment/home, `ephemeral`
  credentials, loopback listener, fresh private bearer capability, no CORS,
  no provider payload logging, no API-key fallback. Maximum lifetime 15 minutes;
  disconnect kills its private child. Abrupt device loss can retain the isolated
  session until that deadline; this is not provider revocation.
- Flutter targeted verification: **17 PASS** (14 new + 3 affected panel tests).
  Python bridge: **9 PASS**, including actual loopback HTTP with simulated provider.
  Focused analysis: **no issues**. Real binary: **unauthenticated prelogin PASS**.
  Existing 77 rename, 17 protocol, and unaffected foundation gates reused.
- APK: **debug build / package / signature / entrypoint PASS**. Package
  `com.lexiquest.app.ariTest`, SDK 26–36, v2 Android debug signature; no auth/pairing
  files bundled. SHA-256 `21d82cb6be433bdce41fe78506372be009472cb7928147c98d258077817478db`.
  First build ignored the environment-only Gradle flag; package inspection caught
  it before installation. Explicit project argument fixed the artifact. No APK
  was installed. Inherited Kotlin/deprecation warnings remain build warnings.

Review was performed in this task without subagents. Fixed: draft loss on offline,
cancelled-login child cleanup, native JSON charset handling, and isolated package
build argument. Remaining runtime boundary: owner/account tests use canonical
database changes, not a live Firebase sign-in. The test app uses a separate local
database and does not bootstrap cloud/research services.

## Continue on Vivo

Build (already passed; do not repeat without changed inputs):

```powershell
flutter build apk --debug --target lib/main_ari_test.dart --dart-define=ARI_LOCAL_TEST=true --android-project-arg=ariLocalTest=true --target-platform android-arm64
```

Artifact: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk`. Connect the designated
Vivo using a data-capable USB cable. If ADB says unauthorized, accept its RSA
prompt on the phone. Do not uninstall, clear app data, restart global ADB, or
change device security on the user's behalf. Inspect serial/manufacturer, install
the verified APK with `adb -s <serial> install -r <apk>`, then run:

```powershell
python tool/experiments/ari_app_server/login_bridge.py --binary C:/Users/Phet/AppData/Local/Programs/OpenAI/Codex/bin/codex.exe --adb C:/Users/Phet/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb.exe --serial <verified-vivo-serial>
```

The bridge provisions only the isolated debug app's private files via stdin, sets
one `adb reverse` mapping, refuses an occupied port, and expires after 15 minutes.
Open/reopen that app after provisioning. User selects Connect → OpenAI, enters
credentials privately and returns to press the explicit status button. Stop all
browser/screen/DOM/log inspection throughout credential entry. Never request a
code/password/token in chat. Device-code support is beta and requires the ChatGPT
security setting; its browser opening and explicit native return check passed in this session.

## Unresolved acceptance

The [pricing documentation](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/pricing) describes
continuation using available credits. This review has not established a
provider-enforced per-request quota-only switch, so a usage precheck cannot be
treated as proof of no paid continuation. [Configuration](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/config-file/config-sample)
documents individual tool switches, but a minimal tool-free inference setup has
not been validated against the pinned binary. Those are prerequisites for the
remaining inference adapter, not evidence that such support is impossible.

Login-only physical acceptance passed. Free-Thailand, provider-revoke, hosted-distribution, V2, E7, inference and pilot acceptance remain unclaimed. No successor task was dispatched. Existing source gates were reused because implementation files were unchanged.

## Autonomous physical testing — 2026-09-21

User delegated device control, diagnosis and repairs. [Coverage matrix](device-test-matrix.json) and [sanitized observations](device-observations.jsonl) record actual steps. The installed main app is version 1.0.0 (23), last updated 2026-09-13; its exact source SHA is unconfirmed. Five primary tabs opened. CSV saved on-device (file existence verified, content validation pending). AI in the main app still uses the separate key-based integration. Quiz configuration accepted more questions than available and displayed a misleading no-vocabulary message; count-specific recovery is implemented and all 31 Quiz screen tests pass; on-device retest is pending. USB transport became offline during retest; targeted reconnect did not restore control. Remaining menus, gameplay completion, persistence, camera, audio accuracy and live provider acceptance are explicitly pending. No user account sign-out, data clearing, purchases or research activation occurred.

Prepared `lib/main.dart` local-learning-preview APK in isolated `com.lexiquest.app.ariTest`: build, package and v2 signature verified; SHA-256 `20460f8e7f93f5e852d61b3b818b5364f7d22997b07c6945f33b0d775952ab9b`. Cloud sync disabled by preview profile. Not installed because transport remains offline. Focused analysis: no issues. Test-only source verification does not close physical retest or whole-app acceptance.
